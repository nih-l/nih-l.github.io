      Until you die
      I will be suffocating

      Until you die
      I will be striving
          and failing
      to read what you want from me
      what you wanted
          and failed to get
      from yourself

      Until you die
      I will self mutilate
      I will writhe and contort in agony
      trying to shape myself into someone you approve
      someone I surmise you might approve
      based on your million inconsistent assertions

      Until you die
      I will be looking for some goddamn consistency
      some set of aims to set
      to make you less miserable
          (content is too much to ask?)
      to make you stop complaining
      not realizing
      that your complaints are about your own failures
      your own shortcomings
      your own fear

      Until you die
      I will keep trying to understand you
      I will keep trying to get closer
      only to keep getting too close
      only to collapse in the face of my own
          (potential?)
        inadequacies
      which i now understand only too well

      Until you die
      I will keep struggling for some air
      some faith
      some hope
      that the world is not as vicious
      as malevolent
      as you tell me it is
      (it isn't)
      that one _can_ brave the odds and make something
      despite the towering wall of difficulty.

      Until you die
      I will be screaming
      'let me be'
      only to stifle myself into a state of guilty complacency
      because I don't want you to die
      because you sacrificed your being for me
          (at what cost, see)
      because you brought me to life
          (as if that's inherently a good thing
              -- is that a glimpse of faith I capture?)

      Until you die
      I will be leaving
          leaving you
      in search of freedom
      in search of breath
      wilfully shutting my eyes
      to my own feelings of guilt

      Until you die
      I will not exist.
