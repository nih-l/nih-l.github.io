      A Love Letter
      20.09.2020
      rs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEGVuH8JcN4

      I want to say I love you
      but I can’t

      I want to let go of my self
      but I can’t

      Numb
      Lifeless
      Fear

      I seek
      that one person
      to merge
      to dissolve
      to let my soul free
      to take whatever tiny this ‘me’ has to offer
      that tiny glowing warm ember
      place it onto their open palms
      and let them carry it
      let my soul go
      let it dissolve into the stream of their soul
      I seek that river of a person
      a river in which I will just flow
      towards peace and in peace
      a river that will not damage
      will not hurt
      but i happen to know
      that no man is a river
      and even worse
      I know that you are not.

      Longing and heartache.
      For what?
