      WHY I CAN'T WRITE
      20.06.2020

      Henry Miller asked me
        why I can't write.

      I can't write, because I have nothing to say.

      I can't write, because my soul is like a knot
      It's twisting and turning and almost exploding
      The more I try the more it twists
      My heart is bulging out of its own veins
      My veins constricting like vines around a fruit

      And what do I have to say

      Nothing, there is Nothing
      I don't have the words
      words, weak words
      what good are they

      I try to relieve myself
      I try to unburden
      Take out my heart and throw it
      To anyone who wants it
      To the void
      To live free without a heart
      light like a feather

      But when i pick up my heart and stare at it
      It's dark and rigid, like a stone
      I see a stone staring back at me

      So I cannot but swallow it back
      a stone where my heart should be
      a cold dead piece of stone at the center of my existence
      a dead battery running a lifeless engine
      I am empty
